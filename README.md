# react-blog-example
This repository is to showcase an example front-end React application using Typicode's Placeholder JSON API. In this case, we are building a small blog application.

## Project Goals

- Have an index page that displays all posts from the appropriate API endpoint.
- Clicking a post navigates to a "post details" page that includes:
  - Post title and body.
  - Post author information from the appropriate API endpoint.
  - Associated comments from the appropriate API endpoint.
- An Author details page that includes all data from the appropriate API endpoint on an author.
- Integrated front-end routing using `react-router`.
- Fully responsive design using Bootstrap or a similar CSS framework.
- Implement a build tool, such as `webpack`, to build the application into static files.

## How To Build

For Development With `webpack-dev-server` (Includes Hot Loading): `npm run-script dev`

For Production With `webpack` (Compiles Files to `build` Directory): `npm run-script build`
